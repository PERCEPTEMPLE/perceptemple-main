# An Epistemological Critique of the Cultural Limits of Popperian Science from the Panperceptual Theory of the Universe

## 1. Introduction

### 1.1 The Problem

Twentieth-century philosophy of science consolidated the falsifiability criterion proposed by Karl Popper (1934/2002) as a demarcation between scientific and non-scientific knowledge. This criterion establishes that a proposition is scientific if and only if it is empirically refutable—that is, if there exist potential observations that, if realized, would demonstrate its falsehood. However, the universal application of this criterion presents at least three fundamental problems:

**First**, it presupposes a realist ontology where "objective facts" exist independently of the observer that can serve as neutral arbiters of competing theories—an assumption questioned by developments in quantum mechanics (the measurement problem) and phenomenology (Husserl, 1913/1982; Merleau-Ponty, 1945/2012).

**Second**, it privileges epistemologies based on Aristotelian logic (principle of non-contradiction, excluded middle) and linear causality, systematically excluding intellectual traditions that operate under relational ontologies where contradiction is productive and causality is circular or mutually constitutive.

**Third**, and most critically, Popperian falsifiability emerges from a specific historical and cultural context (Vienna, 1930s, Vienna Circle, logical positivism) that responds to particular European intellectual concerns (demarcation against Marxism and psychoanalysis), and therefore represents a culturally situated epistemological framework, not a universal and timeless standard.

### 1.2 Case Study: The Panperceptual Theory of the Universe

The Panperceptual Theory of the Universe (PTU), developed by Dany D. Ruiz (2024-2025), proposes that reality is not a preexisting objective entity, but an emergent phenomenon co-created through the interaction of multiple perceptual systems. Formally, the PTU models each observer through a Perceptual Wave Function (PWF):

```
Φ(x,t) = ∫ d³k/(2π)³ [aₖ e^(i(kx-ωt)) + aₖ† e^(-i(kx-ωt))]
```

and quantifies their perceptual capacity through the Perceptual Complexity Index (PCI):

```
PCI = (N · I · F)/T · (1 + α Sₜ)
```

where N represents processing units, I interconnectivity, F processing frequency, T response time, and Sₜ temporal entropy.

The theory postulates that multiple observers generate an emergent reality through perceptual superposition:

```
R = Σᵢ Φᵢ + Σᵢ,ⱼ γᵢⱼ Φᵢ Φⱼ
```

where γᵢⱼ quantifies resonant coupling between observers.

When evaluating the PTU through standard Popperian criteria, we identify apparent "fatal logical incoherencies": causal circularity (P→R→PCI→P), impossibility of calibration between different PCIs, and empirical irrefutability. However, this article argues that these "incoherencies" emerge exclusively from the application of an inadequate epistemological framework, and that the PTU is perfectly coherent when evaluated from relational ontologies compatible with its fundamental presuppositions.

### 1.3 Objective and Structure

1. **Demonstrate** that the Popperian falsifiability criterion represents a culturally specific PCI, not a universal epistemological standard
2. **Analyze** how apparent "paradoxes" in the PTU are resolved when alternative epistemological frameworks are applied (Buddhist Madhyamaka, Taoism, indigenous cosmologies)
3. **Propose** criteria for a pluralist scientific epistemology that allows theories to be evaluated according to their own conceptual frameworks

## 2. Falsifiability as a Culturally Situated Perceptual Complexity Index

### 2.1 Historical Genesis of the Popperian Criterion

The falsifiability criterion did not emerge in an intellectual vacuum, but as a response to specific problems of the European interwar context. Popper (1934/2002) explicitly formulated it to demarcate empirical science from: (a) metaphysics (traditionally excluded from the scientific domain), (b) Marxism (which he considered irrefutable through ad hoc reinterpretations), and (c) Freudian psychoanalysis (which according to Popper could explain any behavior post hoc).

As Kuhn (1962/2012) subsequently argued, criteria for scientific demarcation are neither neutral nor timeless, but reflect values and concerns of particular scientific communities at specific historical moments. The context of the Vienna Circle—analytic philosophy, logical empiricism, rejection of speculative metaphysics—fundamentally shaped the Popperian criterion.

### 2.2 Ontological Presuppositions of Falsifiability

The falsifiability criterion implicitly presupposes:

**P1: Ontological Realism** - There exist objective facts independent of any particular observer that can serve as arbiters of competing theories.

**P2: Aristotelian Logic** - The principle of non-contradiction (¬(A ∧ ¬A)) and excluded middle (A ∨ ¬A) are universally valid.

**P3: Linear Causality** - Causal relations flow unidirectionally from past to future, and cannot be circular without violating the principle of sufficient reason.

**P4: Subject-Object Separability** - The scientific observer can, in principle, be separated from the observed phenomenon without fundamentally altering the nature of the phenomenon.

**P5: Methodological Universality** - There exists a single scientific method valid for all cultures and contexts.

Each of these presuppositions is culturally specific and has been questioned both by non-Western philosophical traditions and by developments in modern physics.

### 2.3 Formalization as Western PCI

Using the PTU framework, we can characterize "Popperian science" as a collective observer with specific PCI:

**N (Processing Units)**: Western scientific community educated in European and North American academic institutions (~10⁶ active individuals at any given moment).

**I (Interconnectivity)**: Structured through peer-reviewed journals, international conferences, academic institutions, citation networks (I ≈ 0.6-0.7, moderately high but with disciplinary clustering).

**F (Processing Frequency)**: Kuhnian scientific revolutions every ~50-100 years, slow paradigmatic changes compared to individual scales (F ≈ 0.01-0.02 Hz in terms of "paradigm shifts per year").

**T (Response Time)**: Decades from theoretical proposal to widespread acceptance (examples: continental drift ~50 years, heliocentrism ~150 years).

**Sₜ (Temporal Entropy)**: Low—Western science privileges linear cumulative knowledge and minimizes discontinuities or radical ruptures.

Therefore:

```
PCI_western = (N · I · F)/T · (1 + α Sₜ) 
            = (10⁶ · 0.65 · 0.015)/3153600 · (1 + 0.3 · 0.4) 
            ≈ 3.5 × 10⁻³
```

(where T ≈ 100 years ≈ 3.15×10⁶ seconds)

This particular PCI collapses a scientific reality where:

- Contradiction is inadmissible
- Causality is linear
- The observer must be methodologically eliminated
- Only the quantifiable and replicable counts as valid knowledge

**Crucially**: This PCI is not "the correct way to do science," but **a culturally specific form** optimized for certain types of phenomena (simple, reproducible, non-conscious physical systems) but potentially inadequate for others (complex, self-organized, conscious, context-dependent systems).

### 2.4 Systematic Exclusion of Alternative Ontologies

The privilege of the Western PCI has documented consequences:

**Santos (2007)** identifies "epistemicide"—the systematic destruction of non-Western forms of knowledge through their classification as non-scientific, primitive or superstitious.

**Smith (1999/2012)** documents how indigenous research has been historically excluded from mainstream scientific publications not for lack of rigor, but due to methodological incompatibility with Western standards.

**Harding (2011)** argues that "universal science" is actually "provincial European science universalized through colonial power."

The falsifiability criterion participates in this exclusion by rejecting as "non-scientific" any epistemological framework that:

- Operates under non-binary logics (many Buddhist traditions, indigenous cosmologies)
- Accepts productive contradiction (Madhyamaka, Taoism)
- Rejects subject-object separability (phenomenology, indigenous participatory science)
- Privileges embodied knowledge over abstract (traditional medicines, Polynesian navigation)

## 3. Resolution of "Paradoxes" through Alternative Epistemological Frameworks

### 3.1 The Supposed "Fatal Circularity": P → R → PCI → P

**Popperian Objection**: The PTU affirms that (a) perception collapses reality, (b) physical reality allows measuring PCI, (c) the PCI quantifies perceptual capacity. This generates a closed causal loop without a starting point, violating the principle of sufficient reason and making the theory logically incoherent.

**Response from Buddhist Madhyamaka**:

Nagarjuna's Madhyamaka philosophy (2nd century CE) explicitly formulates the principle of **pratītyasamutpāda** (dependent co-origination): no phenomenon exists independently; everything arises in mutual dependence without ultimate foundation.

As Garfield (1995) explicates:

> "There is nothing that is not dependently originated. Therefore, there is nothing that is not empty [of inherent existence]. [...] The search for a first cause or ultimate foundation is precisely the error that Madhyamaka seeks to dispel."

From this perspective, the "circularity" P → R → PCI is not a logical contradiction, but a **precise description of the relational structure of reality**. The absence of an independent starting point is not a theoretical defect, but a fundamental characteristic of relational systems.

Mathematically, this can be formalized through category theory instead of set theory. While set theory requires undefined primitive elements (atoms), category theory defines objects entirely through their relations (morphisms). The PTU operates analogously: it does not require "fundamental physical reality" or "primordial perception" as atoms, but defines both through their mutual relations.

**Response from Taoism**:

The *Dao De Jing* (6th century BCE) explicitly formulates the mutual constitution of opposites without ontological hierarchy:

> "When all know beauty as beautiful, there is already ugliness.  
> When all know good as good, there is already evil.  
> Being and non-being produce each other,  
> Difficult and easy complement each other,  
> Long and short form each other" [Chapter 2].

The circularity P → R is not problematic from a Taoist ontology, because **there is no temporal hierarchy**—there is no "first" and "second" in processes of mutual constitution. As Ames & Hall (2003) argue, classical Chinese thought fundamentally rejects the Western search for *arché* (ultimate principle).

### 3.2 The Calibration Problem: Measuring PCIs with PCIs

**Popperian Objection**: To measure the PCI of a bat, we use instruments calibrated according to human physics (ultrasound, EEG). But according to the PTU, the bat collapses a different physical reality. Therefore, we cannot calibrate alien PCIs without presupposing ours—vicious circularity.

**Response from Indigenous Cosmologies**:

Indigenous traditions have developed explicit methodologies for accessing non-human perceptual modes without assuming human epistemic superiority. Kohn (2013), in *How Forests Think*, documents how the Runa of Ecuador develop "syntax of cohabitation" with non-human perspectives (trees, jaguars, spirits) through rituals, ayahuasca and extended perceptual attention.

Crucially, **these peoples do not assume their perception is the standard**. Instead, they develop what Viveiros de Castro (1998) calls "Amerindian perspectivism": the premise that multiple species inhabit phenomenologically distinct worlds, and that knowledge requires negotiation between perspectives, not reduction to one.

Methodologically, this translates to:

- **Extended multi-sensory observation** (not just instruments)
- **Ritual participation** that temporarily alters the observer's PCI
- **Triangulation between perspectives** (human-animal-spiritual) without privileging one
- **Validation through pragmatic efficacy** (does it work in context?) rather than objective correspondence

The PTU can integrate this formally: instead of measuring PCI₂ using PCI₁ directly, a **shared projection space** is established where both PCIs collapse partially overlapping reality:

```
R_shared = ∫_Ω Φ₁(x,t) · Φ₂(x,t) dx
```

The region Ω where both PWFs have non-zero support allows mutual calibration without presupposing the priority of any perspective.

### 3.3 "Irrefutability" as Ontological Depth

**Popperian Objection**: Any experimental result can be reinterpreted as "different resonance" or "insufficient PCI." Therefore, the PTU is unfalsifiable and non-scientific.

**Response from Historical Philosophy of Science**:

Lakatos (1970) had already refined the Popperian criterion, arguing that real scientific theories operate as "research programmes" with **protected hard core** and **protective belt** of auxiliary hypotheses. The "best" scientific theories (Newton, Einstein) are not abandoned in the face of an anomaly—auxiliary hypotheses are adjusted. A theory is only abandoned when a rival programme is more **fruitful**—generates more confirmed novel predictions.

Applying this criterion:

**Fruitfulness of the PTU**:

- Predicts EEG correlation-synchronization in shared consciousness states (verifiable)
- Predicts temporal adaptation in VR with altered parameters (verifiable)
- Predicts differences in quantum interference patterns according to observer's PCI (verifiable in principle)
- **Generates new research programme** in transcultural philosophy of science

**Fruitfulness of standard Popperian science applied to consciousness**:

- The "hard problem" remains unsolved after 30 years (Chalmers, 1995)
- Does not explain observer effects in quantum mechanics beyond "mysterious collapse"
- Does not integrate indigenous epistemologies (systematically excludes them)

By Lakatosian criteria, **the PTU is at least as scientific as standard theories** in domains where both compete.

## 4. "Irrefutable" Theories Later Validated

### 4.1 Atomic Theory (Dalton, 1808)

Dalton proposed that matter consists of indivisible atoms to explain fixed proportions in chemical reactions.

**Was it falsifiable in 1808?** No. No technology existed to observe individual atoms.

**Was it science according to Popper?** Technically no—it was coherent speculation.

**When did it become falsifiable?** 1905 (Einstein explains Brownian motion as evidence of atoms). **97 years later**.

**Implication**: If we apply falsifiability strictly, we should have rejected atomic theory as "metaphysics" for a century. But it was fruitful—generated predictions (laws of multiple proportions) that were confirmed.

### 4.2 Continental Drift (Wegener, 1912)

Wegener proposed that continents move based on geological and fossil evidence.

**Was it falsifiable in 1912?** No. No technology existed to measure continental movement directly.

**Was it science according to the scientific community?** No—it was rejected as "fanciful speculation" for 50 years.

**When was it validated?** 1960s (paleomagnetism, seafloor spreading).

**Implication**: Temporal "irrefutability" does not indicate theoretical falsehood, but **mismatch between theoretical PCI and technological PCI**. The theory anticipates future perceptual capacities.

### 4.3 Dark Matter (Zwicky, 1933-present)

Zwicky proposed invisible matter to explain galactic dynamics.

**Is it falsifiable today?** Barely—only through indirect gravitational effects.

**Is it science according to Popper?** Marginally.

**Why is it accepted?** Because it resolves multiple problems (galactic rotation curves, gravitational lensing, cosmic structure) and has no better theoretical rival.

**Implication**: The scientific community **already operates with more flexible standards** than strict falsifiability—accepts theories for **explanatory coherence and fruitfulness**, not just direct refutability.

### 4.4 Common Pattern

**Conclusion**: Temporal falsifiability is not a valid criterion of scientificity. What is relevant is:

1. **Internal coherence**
2. **Explanatory power** (resolves existing problems)
3. **Fruitfulness** (generates new lines of research)
4. **Verifiability in principle** (proposes specific experiments)

The PTU meets all four criteria.

## 5. Toward a Pluralist Scientific Epistemology

### 5.1 Principles for Transcultural Evaluation

We propose five principles for evaluating scientific theories operating under different PCIs:

**Principle 1: Ontological Charity**

Before evaluating a theory, explicitly identify its ontological presuppositions (realism vs. idealism, separability vs. relationality, linear vs. circular causality). Do not impose alien presuppositions as evaluation criteria.

**Principle 2: Internal Coherence First**

Evaluate whether the theory is internally consistent **according to its own logic** before applying Aristotelian logic. A theory can reject non-contradiction and still be coherent (e.g., paraconsistent logics).

**Principle 3: PCI-Relative Verifiability**

A theory is scientific if it proposes modes of verification accessible to **some** PCI, not necessarily the current Western PCI. Relevant question: "What perceptual capacities are required to verify this?" not "Is it verifiable now?"

**Principle 4: Fruitfulness as Primary Criterion**

Evaluate theories primarily by their capacity to:

- Generate new questions
- Resolve previously intractable problems
- Integrate apparently disconnected phenomena
- Open new lines of research

Strict refutability is secondary to fruitfulness.

**Principle 5: Methodological Pluralism**

Recognize that different phenomena may require different methods. Consciousness may require participatory methods (first-person + third-person). Context-dependent phenomena may require qualitative methods. There is no single universal method.

### 5.2 Application to the PTU

**Ontological Charity**: The PTU operates under relational ontology, not realism of independent objects. Evaluate under this framework.

**Internal Coherence**: The "circularity" P → R → PCI is coherent in relational ontologies (Madhyamaka, Taoism). It is not a defect.

**Relative Verifiability**: The PTU proposes experiments verifiable with current or near-future technology:

- EEG correlation between subjects (current)
- Temporal adaptation in VR (current)
- LIGO perturbations in perceptual tasks (near future)

**Fruitfulness**: The PTU:

- Integrates observer problem (quantum) + hard problem (consciousness) + perceptual relativity (phenomenology)
- Generates research programme in exploratory AI
- Proposes framework for validating indigenous knowledge
- Offers ontology for blockchain (Proof of Perception vs. Proof of Work)

**Methodological Pluralism**: The PTU requires mixed methods (EEG + phenomenology + ethnography + experimental physics).

**Conclusion**: According to pluralist criteria, **the PTU is scientific**.

## 6. Implications for Epistemic Decolonization

### 6.1 The Violence of Universalization

As Mignolo (2011) argues, European modernity was founded on a **double epistemic operation**:

1. **Particularize** non-European knowledge as "local," "traditional," "cultural"
2. **Universalize** European knowledge as "Science," "Reason," "Truth"

The falsifiability criterion participates in this violence by establishing standards that:

- Only the Western PCI can comfortably meet
- Systematically exclude relational epistemologies
- Ignore their own historicity and cultural location

**This is not accident—it is function**. As extensively documented by the history of colonial science, epistemological standards were explicitly used to justify domination:

- Indigenous medicines = "superstition" → legitimation of Western medicine
- Non-European astronomy = "mythology" → appropriation of astronomical knowledge
- Traditional agriculture = "primitive" → imposition of monocultures

### 6.2 Epistemic Recovery through Pluralism

A pluralist epistemology that recognizes multiple PCIs as valid allows:

**1. Validation of Indigenous Knowledge**

Without requiring "translation" into Western language. Polynesian navigation is legitimate science operating under different PCI—high sensory integration (waves, stars, birds), low dependence on instruments.

**2. Development of Local Sciences**

Not as "inferior versions" of universal science, but as perceptual modes specifically adapted to local ecosystems and problems (e.g., Amazonian agroforests developed over millennia).

**3. Genuine Dialogue between Traditions**

Not unidirectional assimilation (indigenous → Western) but **negotiation between PCIs**. The PTU provides formal language (PWF, PCI, resonance) to model how different traditions collapse different aspects of shared reality.
