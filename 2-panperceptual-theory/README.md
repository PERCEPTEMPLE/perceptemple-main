# 🎨 Theoretical Framework of the Panperceptual Theory of the Universe (TPU)

This directory is the **conceptual heart of PercepTemple**, housing the **Panperceptual Theory of the Universe (TPU)**. The TPU proposes a revolutionary framework that posits that perception is not a passive process, but an active engine that **co-creates reality** through resonance.

Here you will delve into the fundamental principles and the profound evolution of the TPU, exploring how observation has shaped our understanding of the universe throughout history and the need for a paradigmatic break in contemporary science.

You will discover the detailed development of this theory, including its mathematical proposal for the Perceptual Wave Function (PWF) and Perceptual Complexity Index (PCI), as well as innovative concepts such as emergent temporalities, the Perceptual Resonance Atomic Model (PRAM), and perceptual dynamics that encompass dreams, simulations, and physical reality.

We invite you to explore this interdisciplinary framework that seeks to unify physics, neuroscience, philosophy, and artificial intelligence, revealing how reality emerges from diverse perceptual interactions, from the subatomic to the cosmic.
