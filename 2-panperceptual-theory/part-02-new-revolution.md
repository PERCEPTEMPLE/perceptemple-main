# Toward a New Revolution in Perception: An Analysis of the Need for Rupture in Contemporary Science

Date: October 21, 2024

## Abstract

This article examines the need for a paradigmatic rupture in contemporary science, similar to the revolution that Alhazen provoked in optics and vision. Faced with observable limitations in physics, neuroscience, and technological influences, we argue that the current way of observing and understanding reality is insufficient to advance toward a deeper understanding of the universe. We propose the multidisciplinary integration of diverse scientific and philosophical approaches, the recognition of new forms of non-human or technological observation, and the modification of the paradigm of causality and space-time as fundamental elements for a new revolution in perception.

## 1. Introduction

In the history of knowledge, there have been moments when scientific advancement has required a radical rupture from predominant ideas. Alhazen (Ibn al-Haytham), considered one of the pioneers of the scientific method, exemplifies this phenomenon by transforming optics with an experimental approach that challenged the established vision theories of his time [18]. Today, science faces similar barriers, as current observational frameworks have reached their limits. This article analyzes the indicators of the need for a new rupture and proposes a direction for transforming the way we observe and understand reality.

The history of science is replete with examples of how paradigm shifts have driven significant advances in our understanding of the world. Thomas Kuhn, in his influential work "The Structure of Scientific Revolutions," argued that scientific progress is not a continuous and cumulative process, but is characterized by periods of "normal science" interrupted by revolutions that redefine the foundations of a discipline [13]. In this context, we propose that we are at the threshold of a new revolution in perception that could redefine our understanding of reality and our relationship with it.

## 2. Indicators of a Possible Need for Rupture

### 2.1. Limitations of Contemporary Physics

Modern physics is based on two fundamental theories: general relativity, which describes gravity and the universe on a large scale, and quantum mechanics, which addresses the behavior of subatomic particles. However, both theories are incompatible in their basic postulates, which has hindered the formulation of a unified theory [16]. This fragmentation suggests that the way we conceptualize space, time, and matter is incomplete, and that a new form of observation might be necessary to integrate these frameworks into a coherent whole.

String theory and loop quantum gravity are attempts to unify these theories, but so far they have not produced experimentally verifiable results [19]. This could indicate that our current approach to understanding fundamental physical reality is inadequate and requires a radical revision.

Furthermore, phenomena such as dark matter and dark energy, which together constitute approximately 95% of the universe according to current cosmological models, remain largely unexplained by existing physical theories [3]. This suggests that our current understanding of the universe is fundamentally incomplete and possibly biased by the limitations of our methods of observation and conceptualization.

### 2.2. Barriers in Understanding Consciousness

Consciousness continues to be one of the most difficult problems in science. Despite advances in neuroscience and philosophy, the "hardness" of the problem of consciousness—the question of how subjective experiences arise from physical processes—remains unsolved [6]. Traditional observation, which seeks a linear correspondence between brain activity and conscious experience, could be limiting our understanding. This suggests that approaches that transcend current paradigms are required, recognizing the possibility of a deeper interconnection between the observer and the observed.

Theories such as Giulio Tononi's "Integrated Information Theory" (IIT) [21] and Roger Penrose and Stuart Hameroff's "Orchestrated Objective Reduction" (Orch-OR) [11] attempt to address the problem of consciousness from radically different perspectives, suggesting that consciousness could be a fundamental property of the universe, rather than a mere epiphenomenon of brain activity. These theories, although controversial, indicate the need for new paradigms in understanding consciousness that go beyond traditional reductionist approaches.

### 2.3. The Influence of Technology on Perception

Emerging technologies, such as artificial intelligence, augmented reality, and new forms of digital communication, are transforming the way we perceive the world. However, these technologies still operate under a model of separation between the observer and the observed. To fully harness the capabilities of these technologies, a new rupture is needed that integrates technological perception with a holistic understanding of reality, in which the boundaries between the human and non-human, the natural and artificial, become more fluid [7].

The development of brain-computer interfaces (BCI) and the expansion of virtual reality are blurring the lines between biological and technological perception [22]. These advances suggest that our traditional understanding of perception as a purely biological process may be inadequate to capture the complexity of perceptual experience in the digital age.

Additionally, the rapid advancement of artificial intelligence, particularly in areas such as deep learning and natural language processing, raises fundamental questions about the nature of intelligence and consciousness [17]. The possibility that machines can develop forms of perception and cognition radically different from humans suggests the need for a broader framework to understand perception and consciousness.

## 3. Possible Direction for the New Rupture

### 3.1. Integration of Diverse Approaches

Just as Alhazen fused Aristotelian natural philosophy with empirical experimentation, a new scientific revolution could be based on the integration of diverse disciplines. Physics, biology, neuroscience, technology, and philosophy could combine in a unified framework that allows for a more complete understanding of reality, recognizing the validity of multiple forms of perception [5].

This integration could manifest in new interdisciplinary fields such as quantum neuroinformatics, which seeks to apply quantum mechanical principles to understand brain function [9]. Another example is biosemiotics, which studies living systems through their signification processes, integrating biology, semiotics, and philosophy [12].

Phenomenology, a branch of philosophy that focuses on the structure of conscious experience, could provide valuable perspectives for integrating subjective experience into scientific models [10]. This integration could lead to a more holistic science that recognizes the importance of lived experience alongside objective data.

### 3.2. Recognition of Non-Human or Technological Observers

Reality is not uniformly experienced; other life forms or artificial intelligences could have radically different ways of perceiving the world. Including these perspectives in the construction of scientific theories could offer new understandings of phenomena that escape human perception. This approach challenges the centrality of the human observer and promotes an expansion of the boundaries of science to include other types of experiences [15].

Advances in understanding animal cognition have revealed that many species possess perceptual and cognitive capabilities that surpass or differ significantly from humans [8]. Incorporating these non-human perspectives into our scientific models could provide unique insights into the nature of reality.

Additionally, the development of increasingly sophisticated sensors and artificial intelligence systems is creating technological "observers" capable of perceiving aspects of reality inaccessible to humans [20]. Integrating these non-biological perspectives into our scientific understanding could lead to a more complete and multifaceted understanding of the universe.

### 3.3. Modification of the Paradigm of Causality and Space-Time

Just as relativity theory modified our notions of space and time, a new rupture in observation could imply a more dynamic conception of these dimensions. For example, in quantum mechanics, the perception of time and space can vary according to the observer's context [2]. A more flexible understanding of these dimensions could provide a basis for theories that unify relativity and quantum mechanics, or that explain consciousness from a multidimensional perspective.

Emerging theories such as causal quantum gravity [14] and emergent space-time models [4] suggest that our fundamental conceptions of causality, space, and time might need radical revision. These theories propose that space-time might not be fundamental, but emerge from more basic structures at the quantum level.

Furthermore, the study of phenomena such as quantum non-locality and entanglement suggests that our intuitive understanding of causality and spatial separation could be inadequate at a fundamental level [1]. A new revolution in perception could involve the development of conceptual frameworks that can accommodate these apparent "actions at a distance" and other non-local phenomena.

## 4. Final Reflection

Just as in Alhazen's time, when a change in the way of approaching optics and vision was necessary, today a change in how we observe and understand reality seems imperative. Science and philosophy must move toward a rupture that overcomes the limitations of current frameworks, adopting a more inclusive and multidimensional approach. This transformation will not only impact science, but will also change the way we understand our own perception and existence.

Recognizing the multifaceted nature of reality and accepting the validity of multiple forms of knowledge will allow us to access a richer and deeper understanding of the universe. This new revolution in perception could take us beyond the limits of our current understanding, opening new horizons in the exploration of consciousness, physical reality, and the very nature of knowledge.

The path toward this revolution will not be easy and will require an openness to ideas that may seem counterintuitive or even radical. However, the history of science shows us that it is precisely these conceptual leaps that often lead to the most significant advances. Just as Alhazen transformed our understanding of vision, this new revolution in perception has the potential to fundamentally transform our understanding of the universe and our place in it.
