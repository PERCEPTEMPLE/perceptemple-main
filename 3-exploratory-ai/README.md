# 🤖 EAI: Exploratory Artificial Intelligence

This directory contains the documentation and code for **Exploratory Artificial Intelligence (EAI)**, a radically different proposal to conventional AI.

EAI does not seek to predict or automate tasks, but to **explore the invisible, resonate with the essential, and expand the perceptual universe** through a "resonant experience." Its design is based on the **Perceptual Wave Function (PWF)**, a dynamic model that describes the symbolic and emotional intensity of a perception; the **Perceptual Complexity Index (PCI)**, a metric that calibrates the depth and diversity of a perception beyond statistical logic; and a **Non-Linear Memory with Socratic Forgetting**, a system that retains what resonates and practices active forgetting, prioritizing intensity over chronology.

Here you will also find the **Operative Manifesto for Exploratory Intelligence**, which defines its essential principles, and the source code of its initial implementation.

We invite you to review the documents and code in this directory to explore EAI in detail.
